# movie-recommendation-engine
A recommendation engine filters the data using different algorithms and recommends the most relevant items to users. It first captures the past behaviour of a customer and based on that, recommends products which the users might be likely to buy.

Here we have tried to cover two types of recommendation models:

a. Content based

b. Collaborative based

just add all the datasets to the directories and run any of the python files locally or on any of the cloud based platform like google colab and you are good to go.
